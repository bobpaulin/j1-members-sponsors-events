  Getting Sponsors

	- There is value in Users Group
		- Where professionals that care for their career show up
		- Either looking to learn and network, or pizza
	
	- Letting sponsors free access to your user group is not healthy
		- Fable "golden egg goose"
		- Members get turned-off if it's another Sales pitch and employment venue
		- Sponsors then don't want to help because they don't have neither candidates and havent paid before
		
	- Lock-down your member access
		- Only you can access their communications
		- Don't advertise a sponsor just because they want you to
	
	- Once you have created a group that has value for your members
		- You can start asking for "help" from sponsors as they want access to your members
		- Your members will tolerate some sponsorship interventions as long as they see what you're bringing to the table
				- Better speakers
				- More sessions
				- More topics
				- Pizza?
		- And as long as they are not the focus of your user group 
		
	
	- Capitalize on this value to get sponsors
  		- Depends on aggresiveness and time
